- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some machine learning projects using Python with Streamlit app for demo of models deployment. As an aspiring machine learning engineer, I'm using this opportunity to develop my skills and gain experience in this field. Currently, I'm unemployed and seeking a position as a machine learning engineer, where I can apply my expertise in artificial intelligence and data analysis to build innovative solutions that can make a positive impact in the world.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new machine learning algorithms and techniques, as well as working on improving my programming skills in languages such as Python and SQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects with data scientists and developers. I believe collaboration is key to developing effective solutions and expanding my knowledge in the field.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding job opportunities as a machine learning engineer, data scientist or data analyst. I'm open to any advice or suggestions on how to improve my resume, portfolio, or interview skills.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience working with machine learning algorithms, my approach to problem-solving in the field, or any questions you may have about my projects.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on my LinkedIn profile [[LinkedIn profile link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chua-chen-liang-530b761aa/)], or via email at [chualiang97@gmail.com].
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first artificial neural network was developed in the 1950s? It was designed to simulate the behavior of a single neuron, and it paved the way for the development of modern neural networks that are widely used in machine learning today.
