# ABOUT ME

- üî≠ I'm currently working on several machine learning projects using Python, and I'm using Streamlit to deploy and demo my models. It's been an exciting opportunity to apply my knowledge of machine learning algorithms and data analysis to real-world projects and gain experience in model deployment. Currently, I'm unemployed and seeking a position as a machine learning engineer, where I can apply my expertise in artificial intelligence and data analysis to build innovative solutions that can make a positive impact in the world.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning new machine learning algorithms and techniques, as well as working on improving my programming skills in languages such as Python and SQL.

- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on machine learning projects with data scientists and developers. I believe collaboration is key to developing effective solutions and expanding my knowledge in the field.

- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with finding job opportunities as a machine learning engineer, data scientist or data analyst. I'm open to any advice or suggestions on how to improve my resume, portfolio, or interview skills.

- üí¨ Ask me about my experience working with machine learning algorithms, my approach to problem-solving in the field, or any questions you may have about my projects.

- üì´ You can reach me on my LinkedIn profile [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chua-chen-liang-530b761aa/)], or via email at [chualiang97@gmail.com].

- ‚ö° Fun fact: Did you know that the first artificial neural network was developed in the 1950s? It was designed to simulate the behavior of a single neuron, and it paved the way for the development of modern neural networks that are widely used in machine learning today.
